The data is divided into four sections with a net for each section. 
Each net was trained separately because of time and cpu constraints. 
Currently set to train the last network, so initialize will begin that training.  

Currently set up to save one net's biases and weights.  Training fruit network will 
probably take a few runs to get a high recognition percentage.  After training can
save to corresponding text file.  Unless user trains all fruit networks in one session
best to load the weights from saved files to identify the fruit images. 

To use, first press load fruit b/w to load the weights and biases to the four separate 
nets.  Next press load fruit and choose a fruit from the training folder of the fruits 
folder. If a fruit is selected from the first section id1, please click on id1 button to 
identify the fruit.  The same goes for fruits from other sections, please click on
corresponding id button to see the correct identification results.

Section 1 fruits: Apple - cactus fruit
Section 2 fruits: Carambula - huckleberry
Section 3 fruits: Kaki - Peach flat
Section 4 fruits: Pear - Tangelo
