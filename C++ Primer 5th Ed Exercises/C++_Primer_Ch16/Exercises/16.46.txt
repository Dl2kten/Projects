Exercise 16.46: Explain this loop from StrVec::reallocate in ยง
13.5 (p. 530):
for (size_t i = 0; i != size(); ++i)
	alloc.construct(dest++, std::move(*elem++));

   Assuming a large enough space is already allocated, alloc constructs at dest rvalue
references to lvalue elements, the lvalue elements old location can be clobbered
