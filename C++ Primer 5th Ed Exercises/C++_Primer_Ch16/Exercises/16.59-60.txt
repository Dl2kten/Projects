Exercise 16.59: Assuming s is a string, explain
svec.emplace_back(s).
lvalue s passed to function parameter Args&&, Args deduced as string&, string& &&
collapses to string&, std::forward returns && to type so again string& && collapses
to string&, passed to string copy constructor

Exercise 16.60: Explain how make_shared (ยง 12.1.1) works.
make_shared probably variadic as can return take different types which means different
constructors taking different numbers of parameters, returns temp copy assigned to
shared_ptr, have to dynamically allocate pointer
