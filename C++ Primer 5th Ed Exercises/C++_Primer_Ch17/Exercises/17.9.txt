Exercise 17.9: Explain the bit pattern each of the following bitset
objects contains:
(a) bitset<64> bitvec(32);
(b) bitset<32> bv(1010101);
(c) string bstr; cin >> bstr; bitset<8>bv(bstr);

a) 10 0000 is the bit representation of 32 since bitset is 64, bitvec[6] -> [63], the
high-order bits will be 0's
b) 1111 0110 1001 1011 0101 is the bit representation of 1010101, since size of bv is
greater, the remaining 12 high-order bits will be 0
c) depends on what user enters into bstr, can only be 0's or 1's, if more than 8
characters, will only take the 8 starting from right, less filled with 0's
