Organize the types into an inheritance hierarchy
C++ language

class memory {} - takes up a chunk of memory
class types : public memory {} - takes up various chunks of memory depending on different
types and define how they are read
class variables: public types {} - takes space and has name 
class expressions : class variables {} - gets different memory chunks and applies operator
to form new memory
class functions : class {} - assemble many variables and expressions
class memberfunctions : class functions - adds implicit *this
class class : class memberfunctions {} - adds special member functions constructors etc.

Not sure... maybe division along static memory and temps and heap and other...
